        This week, I mainly did the presentation of project 1, and also touched some Java Script  for the first time.
        <p>
        I think my classmates did a great job on project 1. I had seen a lot of beautiful and perfect web pages in the presentation,
         which made me feel that my own one was very simple and rough. I really admire their learning ability and patience. 
         My project 1 looks a bit messy and the code that built it is actually very messy lol. 
         However, I see other people's web pages that look so good and remind me of some very mature official websites, 
         it's just horrible. These people are just monsters. 
         Also, I don't know how to update my repository on GitHub now, I searched for solutions with my browser and then realized I couldn't understand those methods at all, haha =w=.</p>
<p>
        I've heard the term Java Script for a long time, but never really touched it before this and didn't really understand what it really was. Now I'm very excited about the JS animations, it allows people like me who have only touched a little code to make cool animations.
        The weather on Friday was so bad that I didn't expect that much rain and wind when I went out to class this afternoon, 
        so my shoes got all wet. It was so weird that it didn't stop raining all day!
